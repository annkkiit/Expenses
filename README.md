# Problem Statement

According to the report conducted by the GFLEC, only 24% of the Indian adult population is financially literate. In comparison to other major emerging economies, the financial literacy rate of India is the lowest.

Children are not taught Financial Literacy in schools and don't get any exposure till the time they start earning. 

This hampers the financial development of children and their confidence in handling money and often end up making uncalculated decisions to invest and manage their expenses leading to a life of debt.

# FinEd

A financial app for kids that help them make financial decisions by handling their own money, understanding the basics of investing, and manage their expenses. Our app also allows parents to monitor the financial decisions their children are making.

Our in-app chat is a very user-friendly way to interact with your friends, send across money or splitting the expenses in a group. 
With the introduction of virtual cards, users will get a hands-on experience of trading at a young age. 

With this app we aim to bridge the knowledge gap and promote importance of handling finances at a younger age.
