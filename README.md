**Problem Statement

According to the report conducted by the GFLEC, only 24% of the Indian adult population is financially literate. In comparison to other major emerging economies, the financial literacy rate of India is the lowest.

Children are not taught Financial Literacy in schools and don't get any exposure till the time they start earning. 

This hampers the financial development of children and their confidence in handling money and often end up making uncalculated decisions to invest and manage their expenses leading to a life of debt.
